# COVID19 AI
This is a very simple if-elif-else chatbot for determining if a person needs to be tested for COVID19.
This chatbot also uses face recognition to see if a person is near by, if a person is near by it will ask you some questions.
#
# Contributions
If you might be a possitive or negative case it will add stuff to possibleNegativeCase.txt or possiblePositiveCase.txt.
When testing in possibleNegativeCase.txt and possiblePositiveCase.txt delete anything that you added to it before pushing your code.
