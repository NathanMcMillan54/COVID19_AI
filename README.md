This is a very simple if-elif-else chatbot for determining if a person needs to be tested for COVID19.

If you might be a possitive or negative case it will add stuff to possibleNegativeCase.txt or possiblePositiveCase.txt.


When testing in possibleNegativeCase.txt and possiblePositiveCase.txt delete anything that you added to it before pushing your code.
